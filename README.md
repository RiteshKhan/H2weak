# $nHODLRdD$ and $s-nHODLRdD$
This repository contains mainly two algorithms.
1. The nested hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank matrix in $d$ dimensions ($nHODLRdD$)
2. The semi-nested hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank matrix in $d$ dimensions ($s-nHODLRdD$)
3. , an algorithm for performing fast matrix-vector multiplication in $d$ dimensions. The `HODLRdD` algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/SAFRAN-LAB/HODLRdD), which works for any user-given dimension $d$. But currently, this repository works for $d=2,3$.
