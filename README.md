# The $nHODLRdD$ and $s-nHODLRdD$ algorithms
This repository mainly contains two algorithms.
1. The nested hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank matrix in $d$ dimensions ($nHODLRdD$)
2. The semi-nested hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank matrix in $d$ dimensions ($s-nHODLRdD$)
Users can also run the $HODLRdD$ algorithm by changing the flag in `Makefile`. Currently, this repository works for $d=1,2,3$. 
The $nHODLRdD$ and $s-nHODLRdD$ algorithms are nested and sem-nested versions of the previously proposed $HODLRdD$ algorithm. The `HODLRdD` algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/SAFRAN-LAB/HODLRdD), which works for any user-given dimension $d$.
