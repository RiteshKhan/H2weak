# $nHODLRdD$
The nested hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank matrix in $d$ dimensions. An algorithm for performing fast matrix-vector multiplication in $d$ dimensions. The `HODLRdD` algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/SAFRAN-LAB/HODLRdD), which works for any dimension $d$. But currently, this repository works for $d=2,3$.
