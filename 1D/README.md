# The $\mathcal{H}^2_{ * }$ and ${(\mathcal{H}^2 + \mathcal{H})}_{ * }$ accelerated iterative solver in $1$ D
## It is to be noted that $\mathcal{H}^2_{ * } \equiv HSS$ in $1$ D
In the results folder, we used $\epsilon_{ACA/NCA} = 10^{-12}$ and the GMRES stopping tolerance $\epsilon_{GMRES} = 10^{-12}$.
